# Final Notes

You are not starting from zero â€” you are repositioning yourself.

Bring your leadership experience and combine it with coding ability. That combination is rare, highly valued, and extremely hireable.

Stay disciplined. Build small things consistently. Finish projects. Share your work.

Success is inevitable when you are too steady to ignore.
